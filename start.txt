Getting Started
===============
After [installing](install.html) the package you can run the first
FD script by executing

	cd /your/path/to/FD/
	xmaple

and then executing the following maple command:

	read("fd_first_run.mpl");

which computes the FDA to the following derivatives:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 f(x)}{\partial x^2}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial^3 f(t,x,y)}{\partial t \partial x^2}
$$

Then by taylor expanding the FDA it confirms that the computed
expressions are accurate.

The output of your maple run should look like this:

<FILE="fd_first_run.html">

The files ``fd_first_run.mpl`` and ``fd_first_run.mw`` are in the FD's
main 
directory that you downloaded. Feel free to [contact
Arman Akbarian](http://laplace.phas.ubc.ca/People/arman/Contact.html)
if you have any trouble starting to use FD.

See the [tutorials](tutorials.html) section for more examples on posing
a PDE and solving it using FD.
