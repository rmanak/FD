#Installation

There is indeed nothing to install, you can simply download
the FD package from [[here[dl]]](./FD.tar.gz), extract the files, and 
read the ``FD.mpl`` file in your maple worksheet:

	read("/your/path/to/FD.mpl");

Here is a series of shell commands that would download and extract the package and
execute the first FD script:

	wget http://rmanak.github.io/FD/FD.tar.gz
	tar -xvf FD.tar.gz
	cd FD
	maple < fd_first_run.mpl

See the section [gettin started](start.html) regarding the last command
that executes the first FD script.
