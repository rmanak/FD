About FD
=========

FD is a toolkit for finite difference methods used in solving Partiall
Differential Equations (PDE). Specifically, it is a set of [Maple](http://www.maplesoft.com/) 
tools that provides a high level language to specify a PDE over
a discretized numerical domain and solve it. This toolbox can compute the
Finite Difference Approximation (FDA) equivalent of a PDE and generate
low level language (Fortran) routines and C wrappers to evaluate the FDA
expression or solve it for the dynamical(unknown) field.
The process of posing a PDE as an FDA expression has several complications, including
finding the proper terms for derivatives with correct accuracy,  handling
boundary points, initialization, developing testing facilities and generating
solver routines. FD is designed to simplify these steps while allowing full 
control over the entire process and helps the user to focus on the underlying
physical/mathematical phenomena described by the PDE. It also provides a rapid 
prototyping language to apply various discretization schemes, test the desired 
accuracy and  develop a solid set of routines that are parallel ready 
and can be used within a framework of a HPC infrastructure such as 
[PAMR](http://laplace.physics.ubc.ca/Doc/pamr/PAMR_ref.pdf).
